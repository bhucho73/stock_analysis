# stock_analysis
experimental predictive analysis of stocks using DL techniques for short as well as long term. I have used Technical analysis based indicators combining them with the deep learning to predict the returns. 
It uses Yahoo Finance for financial data, and Tensorflow/Keras for DL and some other financial libraries like TA and Pandas_ta for calculating various indicators needed for stock analysis.
One of the model uses regime detection using Hidden Markov Models and use it in conjunction with MACD for the predictive analysis of short term returns (NIFTY50)
