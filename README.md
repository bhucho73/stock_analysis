# stock_analysis
experimental predictive analysis of stocks for short as well as long term. I have used Technical analysis based indicators combining them with the deep learning to predict the returns. 
It uses Yahoo Finance for financial data, and Tensorflow/Keras for DL and some other financial libraries like TA and Pandas_ta for calculating various indicators needed for stock analysis
